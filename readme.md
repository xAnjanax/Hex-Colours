# Hexadecimal Codes of Colours 

## Description 

Starting off with a blank white background and its hexadecimal colour code, every time the user clicks on the "Click here" button, the background changes in colour, and the respective hexadecimal colour code of that background colour is displayed along with it. Moreover, the heading text changes in colour dynamically, making the overall look a lot more interesting.
